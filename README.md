Use **W, A, S, D** to move and **hold mouse click to control the arm**. 

### Todo
- [X] Create inversion of control system
- [X] Create own implementation of rxjs
- [X] Implement Finite State Machine pattern
- [X] Implement player control
- [X] Implement arm physics
- [X] Implement arm control system on click
- [X] Implement polygonal collision  system
